Developer productivity measures a development team’s ability to produce and deliver adept code directly related to a company’s business outcomes. It can be calculated within any timeframe using various metrics, focusing on real-time team productivity rather than individual productivity.

### Outcomes vs. outputs

### Teams vs. individuals

Developer productivity increases when pain points and frustrations are resolved on a team level, prioritizing the overall organization and structure of the work rather than individual nuances.

Instead of tracking individual metrics like number of commits and average commit size, analyze team metrics like:  

- **Lead time for changes:** the time it takes committed code to enter production
- **Cycle time:** average time between a ticket’s active and complete statuses


## Common pitfalls leaders experience when measuring productivity

- **Inefficient workflows:** time wasted and projects delayed due to poor collaboration, manual processes, and slow or inadequate tools
- **[Scope creep](https://asana.com/resources/what-is-scope-creep):** a lack of focus due to additional project requests and  requirements outside a project’s original expectations
- **Developer workloads:** overcrowded developer schedules lead to late or unfinished projects with poor results
- **[Technical debt](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/erasing-tech-debt?exp=3):** unoptimized processes or software solutions and poor code quality created by tight deadlines, poor reviews, and crowded codebases
- **Context switching:** frequent interruptions or multitasking requests caused by insufficient project planning and mediocre communication

## Existing ways to measure developer productivity

### The SPACE framework

[The SPACE framework](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124):
- **Satisfaction:** individual and team feelings of fulfillment related to their work, team, and company culture that can be measured by employee contentment and burnout
- **Performance:** business- and developer-specific work outcomes that can be measured by project quality, reliability, maintainability, and service health
- **Activity:** the number of actions a developer takes during a given day that can be measured by pull requests, commits, and deployment frequency
- **Communication and collaboration:** quality team or project feedback and ideation that can be measured through internal interviews and onboarding reviews
- **Efficiency:** the ability of a developer or team to make project progress without interruptions, which can be measured through handoff numbers and time between processes

- **Agency:** an individual’s ability to voice disagreements and discuss progress metrics openly with leadership
- **Motivation and self-efficacy:** teams’ ability to see project and objective progress, work on passion projects, and be supported during challenging projects
- **Learning culture:** developers’ ability to learn new skills and share findings with their team
- **Support and belonging:** team support and acceptance of individual differences and needs in regard to both professional and personal experiences
