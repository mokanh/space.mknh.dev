### **What is supply chain logistics?**

Supply chain logistics refers to the management of the production, transportation and distribution of goods throughout a business’ overall supply chain. It encompasses both inbound logistics (how materials and supplies are brought into a business) and outbound logistics (how the business’ resulting products get to retailers and consumers).

Implementing effective logistics can help companies build resilience amid global volatility and gain a competitive advantage.


### Why is supply chain logistics important?

Effective supply chain logistics management helps reduce costs and improve operational efficiency across business processes. By optimizing each part of the supply chain, including demand planning, transportation routes, inventory levels and lead times, companies can save money and time.

Logistics can also help maintain customer satisfaction by ensuring customers receive their orders when and where they expect them.
