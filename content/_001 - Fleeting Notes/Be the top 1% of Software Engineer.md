- Influence is about likability and credibility
- likability plus credibility can bring you a lot of influence
- what languages we're using today may not applicable tomorrow
- blindly following trends is a recipe for failure because you're always going to be a step behind
- We're not going to throw in a bunch of features just to appease every single person. The way we are going to appease every single person is by focusing on the core utility features.
- We wanted to drill in to make sure it works every single time, rather than adding on a bunch of new features
- One way of achieving simplicity is really prioritizing
- It's easy for us to say, i'm going to do ten different things and be really great at it, but it's actually much harder to be focused on a few core features and a few core offerings that we will offer and prioritize them ruthlessly
- achieving simplicity through prioritizing was one of key factors for success
