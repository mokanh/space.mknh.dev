_“With photography a new language has been created. Now for the first time it is possible to express reality by reality. We can look at an impression as long as we wish, we can delve into it and, so to speak, renew past experiences at will.” – Ernst Haas_

"_We can write the new chapters in a visual language whose prose and poetry will need no translation.” – Ernst Haas_

  

_“There are almost too many possibilities. Photography is in direct proportion with our time: multiple, faster, instant. Because it is so easy, it will be more difficult.” – Ernst Haas_

  

_“There are two kinds of photographers: those who compose pictures and those who take them. The former work in studios. For the latter, the studio is the world…. For them, the ordinary doesn’t exist: every thing in life is a source of nourishment.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“The best pictures differentiate themselves by nuances…a tiny relationship – either a harmony or a disharmony – that creates a picture.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“Best wide-angle lens? Two steps backward. Look for the ‘ah-ha’.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“The most important lens you have is your legs.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“The camera doesn’t make a bit of difference. All of them can record what you are seeing. But, you have to SEE.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“Learn by doing or even better unlearn by doing.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“I am not interested in shooting new things – I am interested to see things new.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“You become things, you become an atmosphere, and if you become it, which means you incorporate it within you, you can also give it back. You can put this feeling into a picture. A painter can do it. And a musician can do it and I think a photographer can do that too and that I would call the dreaming with open eyes.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

  

_“There is only you and your camera. The limitations in your photography are in yourself, for what we see is what we are.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“I want to be remembered much more for a total vision than for a few perfect single pictures.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“I prefer to be noticed some day, first for my ideas and second for my good eye…” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

  

_“Only a vision – that is what one must have.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

_“Style has no formula, but it has a secret key. It is the extension of your personality. The summation of this indefinable net of your feeling, knowledge and experience.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

  

_“In every artist there is poetry. In every human being there is the poetic element. We know, we feel, we believe.” – Ernst Haas_

  

  

  

_“Every work of art has its necessity; find out your very own. Ask yourself if you would do it if nobody would ever see it, if you would never be compensated for it, if nobody ever wanted it. If you come to a clear ‘yes’ in spite of it, then go ahead and don’t doubt it anymore.” – Ernst Haas_
