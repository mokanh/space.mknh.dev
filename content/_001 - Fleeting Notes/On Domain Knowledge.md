Our solution as software engineers to the given problem has to be on the sweet spot between under-engineering and over-engineering. Understanding the business will help a lot to weigh those solutions. Here is how to start:

1. **Understanding how your company’s business model works**
	- How does your company generate revenue? How do you get profit out of it?
	- Try to get customer feedback either directly or through a proxy
2. **Understanding your company’s industry**
	- Identify competing products
	- curiosity on how they (competitor) build their product
	- Most of the tech startup ideas come from problems in the existing traditional industry and try to also understand how the traditional industry works
	- Keep up to date with news on your company industry either through subscribing to a newsletter or even as simply as reading a newspaper; it is best if you can find a publication or boo
3. **Be Present at the Engineering x Product Discussion**
	- try to use the knowledge to be curious and critical during a discussion with the product
	- understanding the requirement but also to understand the problem and how the product is supposed to solve it
4. **Identify Improvement**
	- Now that you understand how things work, try to give suggestions on the area you are expertise in
