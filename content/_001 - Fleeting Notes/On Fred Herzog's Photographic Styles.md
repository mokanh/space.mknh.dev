Fred Herzog was born in Germany in 1930, but it was in Vancouver, Canada, where he eventually settled after WWII, that he found his photographic voice. Working as a medical photographer by day, Herzog spent his free time roaming the streets of Vancouver, capturing scenes of urban life with an empathetic and observant eye.

Much of Herzog’s work was produced on Kodachrome, a colour slide film that was difficult to work with in a spontaneous fashion. Herzog’s use of colour was unusual in the 1950s and 60s, a time when art photography was almost exclusively associated with black and white imagery. In this respect, his photographs can be seen as a pre-figuration of the “New Colour” of photographers such as Stephen Shore and William Eggleston, which received widespread acclaim in the 1970s, and the work of contemporary Vancouver photographers such as Roy Arden, Arni Haraldsson, Karin Bubaš and Christos Dikeakos.
