##  The concept of multiplicity

In phenomenology, the multiplicity of phenomena is always related to a unified consciousness. In Bergsonism, “the immediate data of consciousness” (les données immédiates de la conscience) are a multiplicity. Here, two prepositions, “to” and “of,” indicate perhaps the most basic difference between Bergsonism and phenomenology.

- Qualitative Multiplicity
  The idea of qualitative multiplicities is difficult to understand, although it is the heart of Bergson’s thinking.
  
  Qualitative multiplicities are temporal; qualitative multiplicity defines the duration.
  
  The most significant example of qualitative multiplicity is the feeling of sympathy because, in the 1903 “Introduction to Metaphysics,” Bergson defines intuition as sympathy. Here, in _Time and Free Will_, he calls it a moral feeling (_Time and Free Will_, 18–19). Our experience of sympathy begins, according to Bergson, with us putting ourselves in the place of others, in feeling their pain.
  
- Quantitative Multiplicity
  A quantitative multiplicity enumerates things or states of consciousness by means of externalizing one from another in a homogeneous space.
  
  Bergson provides examples of a quantitative multiplicity; the example of a flock of sheep is perhaps the easiest to grasp
