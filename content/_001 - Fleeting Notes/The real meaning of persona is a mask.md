"The real meaning of persona is a mask, such as actors were accustomed to wear on the ancient stage; and it is quite true that no one shows himself as he is, but wears his mask and plays his part. Indeed, the whole of our social arrangements may be likened to a perpetual comedy." ([[Studies in Pessimism - Arthur Schopenhauer]])

"We should not pretend to be what we are not."
