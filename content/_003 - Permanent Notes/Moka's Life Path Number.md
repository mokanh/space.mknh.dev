### Life Path number 7

People born with a Life Path 7 are eternal students of the universe. They are ==introspective individuals== with an unquenchable ==thirst for knowledge== and they ==enjoy looking into the inner workings of things==. Someone with this Life Path is a true thinker who lets their mind lead the way. Pretty much from the moment of birth, ==they are able to skillfully combine the exacting side of their brain with their divine intuitive side to learn about, process, and make sense of life itself==.

The 7 Life Path in Numerology is smart in a knowledgeable way, yet wise in a spiritual way. People with this Life Path number enjoy gaining book smarts, but they are also more connected to their higher self than most and have great access to this inner wisdom. While they are spiritual creatures, though, Life Path 7 people ==don't tend to be the religious type==. ==Strict doctrines that don't make room for new information are a turn-off to these inquisitive folk==.

Similar to The Hermit in a Tarot deck, people born with a Life Path number 7 often go it alone. ==They like the freedom of not having to explain themselves== and ==enjoy the control and possibility of solitude==. Their social circle tends to be a small one ==made up of people with like-minded interests==. They may come across to the world as a bit awkward in groups or when meeting new people. Romantically, people with this Life Path may find it hard to connect on an emotional level with others. They love the part of getting to know someone, asking questions and exchanging answers, but often lack the interest or ability to build a heartfelt bond.

==Professions that require research and problem-solving skills are a perfect fit== for those with a Life Path 7. If given a quiet space to think and work, they'll dive deeper than anyone into a problem and come out with the most valuable and viable solution. Their analytical powers are off the charts and these skills make them an asset to any project or team.
